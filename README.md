# LeanReinforcement

Repository for LeanReinforcement (LR), a hierarchical reinforcement learning agent that learns to write proofs in Lean.

## Gym-like

This repository builds on the gym-like [LeanDojo](<https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanDojo>) interface for interacting with Lean. See the [LeanDojo documentation](https://leandojo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html/) for more information on how to use it.

## Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

For an overview of hierarchical reinforcement learning, see [Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning: A Comprehensive Survey](https://spateria.github.io/data/hrlsurvey_paper.pdf). Relevant sources will be added here as the project progresses.
